## Motion Learning

This module focuses on training motion policies using DeepMimic-style imitation learning.
We use a large set of reference trajectories to teach the policy how to mimic realistic movements.

Once trained, the policy can generalize to novel reference motions which are generated by the GPT module — allowing flexible, controllable motion synthesis.

The learning framework is adapted from Nico’s amazing work [A framework for Reinforcement Learning research.](https://github.com/nico-bohlinger/RL-X) and [One Policy to Run Them All](https://github.com/nico-bohlinger/one_policy_to_run_them_all).
In our setup, we mainly focus on flat (plane) terrains to study different gaits like walk, trot, pace, gallop, etc.
To simply start the training process:
```bash
cd loco_new/experiments
sh slurm_experiment.sh
```
